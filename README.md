# Higher or Lower Game

This is a  interactive Python game based on the "Higher or Lower" format. In this game, the player is presented with two social media accounts and must guess which one has more followers. The game continues until the player makes a wrong guess, and the final score is displayed.

## Features

- Compares two randomly selected accounts from a dataset.
- Displays a formatted description of each account.
- Allows the player to guess which account has more followers.
- Provides feedback on whether the guess is correct.

 **Gameplay:**

    - The game will display two accounts with their descriptions.
    - You will be asked to guess which account has more followers by typing 'A' or 'B'.
    - If you guess correctly, your score increases, and the game continues with a new pair of accounts.
    - If you guess incorrectly, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.

 **Example:**

    ```
